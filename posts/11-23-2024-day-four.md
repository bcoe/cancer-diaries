Picked up a new rental car for a road trip with the family.

Anna and I have both decided to leave our family out of these diaries, so my posts during this trip may be a lot shorter.

# Best Memories

I've been a little overwhelmed by the number of people sending me messages of support and telling me what things I've done or moments we've shared have meant to them.

I've created a directory here called [`best-memories`](./best-memories) and I encourage people to submit these as pull requests. I promise I'll eventually get to reading and approving them all, unlike the messaging systems on my phone and in social media :)
