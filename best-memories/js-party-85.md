# The Changelog's JS Party podcast, episode 85

https://changelog.com/jsparty/85

I got a chance to talk with Mikeal, alongside [@feross](https://github.com/feross) and [@jerodsanto](https://github.com/jerodsanto), on the JS Party podcast, in 2019. As a 16-year-old teenager, it was an amazing opportunity to talk with the people I considered to be essentially the heroes of the JS open source community. Looking back, I consider this talk an important moment im my programming carrer â€“ a few years after it, I became involved in the node-fetch project, founded my own startup, and later joined another one as a full stack developer.
