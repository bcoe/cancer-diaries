# A Christmas Miracle

Did y'all know that Twitter DMs have infinite scrollback?

So, just before Christmas 2014 my wife Svenja, our 1 year old Jack and I were heading to see family in Germany.
We were quite literally sitting at the airport with boarding about to begin when I got a Twitter DM from Mikeal
saying that their new place didn't have heating and asking if they could crash at our place. This was at a time
before airplane wifi, so he really got in at the very last minute for a timely reply.

And, yeah, we didn't need the place cause we were literally leaving and Mikeal and Anna stayed there over the holidays.

When we came back, they had left a new cooking pot set and a full set of pour over coffee equipment.
Nice me thinks this was left as a thank you note, but evil me knows there was probably a little bit of
![Damn bitch, you live like this](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3558d5c8-a72d-4d48-ae63-cd3ab1ae2d14)

Well, we're still making coffee with it every day!

PS: The reason we live in Alameda is Mikeal saying "Yo, check out Alameda. Lots of cool lofts and industrial living".
What we found was suburbia and it was probably for the better.
