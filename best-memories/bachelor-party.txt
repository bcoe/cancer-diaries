For some reason I just remembered this random one. It's obscure. It's pretty
funnny. And it goes waaaaay back. All the way back to your bachelor party.

I think it was day two and I had an incredible hangover. Everything was a bit
surreal. It was sunny, the dirt was warm and you could smell the earth. It
was one of those perfectly clear blue California skies. Beautiful.

We had just got back from a nice drive to the store and we were having this
interesting conversation and we just get out of the car and stood there and
keept having the conversation. While we were chatting, I was eating this ice
cream bar...

I noticed something was crunchy in the ice cream, I kept chewing it but I
was looking at the package, and there wasn't supposed to be anything crunchy
in it...

It took a minute, but after a bit I realized I was chewing what was left of
my own tooth...

Then I remembered, multiple times the night before diving into the pool with
a beer in one hand, and a that fucking handle of whisky in the other. And then
I rememebred how I hit my face with that bottle and thinking, hah, I'm totally fine!
